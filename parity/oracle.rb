# parity/oracle.rb
#
# Ruby "oracle" for apples-to-apples parity testing against the Go port.
#
# It runs the installed `holidays` gem (CODE, at the version pinned in parity/Gemfile)
# but loads OUR region YAML (DATA) from the `definitions/` submodule via
# Holidays.load_custom on startup. So the holiday RULES are identical to what the
# Go port compiles, and any difference in output is a real behavioural difference
# in the engines, not in the data.
#
# ============================================================================
# RUN CONTRACT (stable; the Go harness in a later bead depends on this)
# ============================================================================
#
# Transport: LINE-DELIMITED JSON ("JSON Lines" / NDJSON).
#   - Read: exactly one JSON object per input line on stdin.
#   - Write: exactly one JSON object per output line on stdout, in the same
#     order as the requests. stdout is line-buffered (sync = true), so a Go
#     harness can write a request line and read one response line back.
#   - Blank lines on stdin are ignored.
#   - One malformed/erroring request does NOT abort the process; it yields one
#     error response line, and processing continues with the next line.
#
# REQUEST shape (one JSON object per line):
#   { "func": "<name>", ... }
# Each request MAY carry an "id" passed through verbatim to the response, to
# let the caller correlate out-of-band. Every request carries a "func" naming
# one of the supported functions below, plus that function's arguments.
#
# Dates are always strings "YYYY-MM-DD" (UTC calendar dates, no time/zone).
# Regions are an array of strings, e.g. ["us"] or ["us_va","ca"]; a bare
# string is also accepted and wrapped into a one-element array.
# Options are booleans:
#   "informal": true  -> include informal holidays   (gem flag :informal)
#   "observed": true  -> use observed dates           (gem flag :observed)
#
# RESPONSE shape (one JSON object per line):
#   { "ok": true,  "id": <echoed-or-null>, "func": "<name>", "result": <...> }
#   { "ok": false, "id": <echoed-or-null>, "func": "<name>",
#     "error": "<class>: <message>" }
#
# A "holiday list" result is ALWAYS normalized to a sorted array of objects:
#   [ { "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "name": "..." }, ... ]
# sorted by date ascending, then by name ascending. (regions and other gem
# fields are dropped: the Go port's public API exposes date+name.)

# SUPPORTED FUNCTIONS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1) on
#    req:  { "func":"on", "date":"2024-12-25", "regions":["us"],
#            "informal":false, "observed":false }
#    res:  result = holiday-list   (holidays on that single date)
#
# 2) between
#    req:  { "func":"between", "start":"2024-01-01", "end":"2024-12-31",
#            "regions":["us"], "informal":false, "observed":false }
#    res:  result = holiday-list   (holidays in [start, end] inclusive)
#
# 3) cache_between
#    req:  { "func":"cache_between", "start":"2024-01-01", "end":"2024-12-31",
#            "regions":["us"], "informal":false, "observed":false }
#    res:  result = holiday-list   (the holidays the gem cached for that range;
#                                   gem returns a hash, normalized to the list)
#
# 4) next_holidays
#    req:  { "func":"next_holidays", "count":3, "regions":["us"],
#            "from":"2024-12-01", "informal":false, "observed":false }
#    res:  result = holiday-list   ("from" optional, defaults to gem default)
#
# 5) year_holidays
#    req:  { "func":"year_holidays", "regions":["us"], "from":"2024-01-01",
#            "informal":false, "observed":false }
#    res:  result = holiday-list   (one calendar year starting at "from";
#                                   "from" optional, gem defaults to today)
#
# 6) any_holidays_during_work_week?
#    req:  { "func":"any_holidays_during_work_week?", "date":"2024-12-25",
#            "regions":["us"], "informal":false, "observed":false }
#    res:  result = true | false   (boolean, NOT a holiday list)
#
# 7) available_regions
#    req:  { "func":"available_regions" }
#    res:  result = ["ar","at",...]   (sorted array of region-code strings)
#    This set is DERIVED from the loaded region YAML (the union of every region
#    code appearing in any holiday rule's `regions:` list), matching exactly how
#    the Go port computes holidays.AvailableRegions(). It is deliberately NOT
#    the gem's bundled REGIONS constant, which is baked at compile time and is
#    never refreshed by load_custom.
#
# 8) load_custom
#    req:  { "func":"load_custom", "files":["definitions/us.yaml"] }
#    res:  result = { "loaded": <int> }   (count of files ingested; lets a
#          caller load extra YAML at runtime. The standard region set is
#          already loaded at startup, so this is rarely needed.)
#
# 9) year_holidays_range
#    req:  { "func":"year_holidays_range", "region":"us",
#            "from_year":1970, "to_year":2050,
#            "flag_combos":[{"informal":false,"observed":false}, ...] }
#    res:  result = [ { "year":1970, "informal":false, "observed":false,
#                       "ok":true, "error":null, "holidays":[ {date,name}, ... ] },
#                     ... ]   (one entry per year x flag_combo; a per-entry Ruby
#          failure sets ok=false / error=<class>: <msg> / holidays=[] without
#          aborting the batch. Transport-only batching of year_holidays so the
#          exhaustive sweep makes one round-trip per region instead of one per
#          (year, flag). The Go side still compares (date,name) as deduped SETS.)
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# STARTUP
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# On boot, every definitions/*.yaml (excluding index.yaml, which is an
# aggregator and not a region) is ingested via Holidays.load_custom. The path
# to definitions/ is resolved relative to this file (../definitions), so the
# oracle can be launched from any working directory.
#
# Re-loading a region YAML that the gem already knew does NOT duplicate holidays:
# load_custom merges by region key and overrides cleanly. Verified: loading
# us.yaml twice still yields exactly one "Christmas Day" on 2024-12-25, and
# US-2024 = 10 holidays.
#
# Note on available_regions: load_custom ingests our region RULES, but it does
# NOT refresh the gem's compile-time REGIONS constant. So the
# region set cannot come from the gem. Instead, while loading each YAML at
# startup we collect the union of every region code in that file's holiday
# entries, and available_regions returns that union. This keeps it apples to
# apples with the Go port, which derives its region set the same way.
# ============================================================================

# Activate parity/Gemfile.lock so `holidays` resolves to the version pinned in the Gemfile and
# never silently drifts to whatever is "highest installed". __dir__ is parity/,
# so this holds no matter what working directory the harness launches us from.

# Keep the oracle a closed world over definitions/*.yaml.
#
# The gem ships its OWN vendored copy of the definitions under
# lib/generated_definitions/, frozen at whatever data the gem release was cut
# with. Holidays.load_custom merges our YAML into the same repository those
# vendored rules land in; it does not replace or lock them out. So both can be
# live at once, and then a region resolves to two rule sets.
#
# The gem loads them lazily: for a requested region it looks up a parent region
# and requires that parent's vendored file if it is not already loaded
# (finder/context/parse_options.rb:63-70 -> definition/context/load.rb:11-12).
# Five of our 288 regions map to an aggregate parent we never define, so they
# trigger it:
#   europe <- si, sk     southamerica <- ve     bg <- bg_bg, bg_en
# Querying si therefore pulls in generated_definitions/europe.rb, which carries
# the gem's stale gb rules (pre-fix Christmas/Boxing observed functions). After
# that, gb resolves to BOTH its rules from our YAML and the stale ones, and the sweep
# reports a mismatch that is not real (go-holidays-2z0).
#
# Note we cannot refuse the vendored load outright: load_custom does NOT mark a
# region as loaded, so every query runs this path, and short-circuiting all of
# it leaves the finder with no regions and every query returns nothing.
#
# The distinction that matters is WHAT gets merged. Loading a region's own file
# (target :gb -> gb.rb) re-merges only that region and our rules still
# win. Loading an aggregate (target :europe -> europe.rb) merges every European
# region's rules in one go, which is what appends a second, stale set of gb
# rules. So: delegate for real regions, skip for aggregates.
#
# Testing membership against the region set derived from our own YAML keeps this
# self-maintaining. Any aggregate upstream invents later is absent from our data
# too, so it is skipped without needing a hardcoded list.
